# Instagram Cookie Files Directory
# 
# Place your Instagram cookie files here in Netscape format.
# Files should have .txt extension.
#
# Naming convention:
# - instagram.txt (primary cookie - tried first)
# - instagram_1.txt, instagram_2.txt, etc. (backup cookies)
# - account_name.txt (named by account)
#
# The system will try cookies sequentially if one fails.
# Cookies are sorted by: instagram.txt first, then by modification time.
#
# To export cookies:
# 1. Install a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt" or "EditThisCookie"
# 2. Log into Instagram in your browser
# 3. Export cookies in Netscape format
# 4. Save as .txt file in this directory
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Never commit actual cookie files to git
# - Keep cookies private and secure
# - Rotate cookies periodically
# - Use cookies from trusted accounts only
